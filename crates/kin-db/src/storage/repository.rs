///
/// - The snapshot frame and its checksum are verified exactly as a full decode
///   verifies them, so tampered or truncated bytes refuse here too.
/// - The authority digest is checked against the durable authority record by

/// target trees, and history replay proves the whole payload decodes into a
/// coherent graph. Each of those callers used to clone the entire snapshot and
/// rebuild the graph from scratch, so one commit paid for the whole store four
/// or more times over, and every rebuild repeated the same canonical content
/// hashing. The payload cannot change underneath the sharing: `changes` is
/// final once `admit_changes` returns, every later preparation step mutates
/// only the detached authority metadata, and the single-writer permit
/// serializes the whole preparation.

/// fail-closed and both read the snapshot, so neither needs to own it, and
/// neither result was ever read: the decoded graph was only ever asked to
/// resolve trees, which reads the change map alone.

/// map and Merkle root from the clone, and keeping all of it alive until the
