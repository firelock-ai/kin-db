/// the same replay. Serving a prepared payload costs one decode of a
/// history-bearing frame plus its admission validation, which sits between the
/// two.

/// Measured on the synthetic 20k-entity, 61-change store in release (local,
/// non-citable): clean materialize 212 ms against a 247 ms serve, so serving a
/// clean workspace would be a 16% regression; dirty materialize 612 ms against

/// over here, which costs a win rather than causing a regression.
///
