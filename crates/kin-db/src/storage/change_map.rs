//! The repository change map, decoded from its snapshot on first use.
//!
//! A converted repository's snapshot IS its history: on psf/requests at 6733
//! commits the `changes` map is 93.8 percent of a 1051.5 MiB body, and on the
//! kin repository's own store it is 94.8 percent of 3326 MiB, while the
//! entities and relations a daemon serves are zero bytes of either file. An
//! open that decodes the whole body therefore retains about 2.7x the file for
//! a map that the served graph reads by reference and a commit reads once.
//!
//! [`ChangeMap`] is the map's type in [`GraphSnapshot`](super::format::GraphSnapshot).
//! It dereferences to the `HashMap` every reader already expects, so a read
//! site compiles untouched and pays the decode the first time it is reached,
//! and never before. An open that leaves the map encoded holds the snapshot
//! file it came from and the byte range the map occupies in it; the first
//! history read re-reads that frame, proves it is the frame the open verified
//! by comparing the body checksum it carried then, and decodes the one
//! element. Nothing about the on-disk format moves: a MessagePack positional
//! array is self-delimiting, so one element of a body decodes exactly as it
//! decodes inside the whole.
