//! What one persisted operation record costs in memory, on a real store.
//!
//! Two numbers the region walk could not produce, because a walk reads bytes at
//! rest and this asks what those bytes weigh once decoded and once hashed.
//!
//! **The receipts figure.** FIR-3064's retrim stopped a rewrite carrying every
//! inherited fat receipt forward, worth a MEASURED 411,771,106 bytes on the
//! wire on a converted Linux subtree. The wire number is exact; what a serving
//! process actually stops holding is the DECODED size of that record, and a
//! decoded delta payload is larger than its encoding because a Rust enum is
//! sized by its largest variant and strings cost more decoded than
//! length-prefixed. Registered before this harness existed: **700 to 850 MB**.
//!
//! **The identity figure.** `RepositoryOperationRecord::identity_hash` calls
//! `canonicalized()`, which CLONES the whole record in order to sort three of
//! its collections, and then serializes the copy;
//! `identity_payload()` allocates nothing, because it is a borrowed view. So a
//! single identity on that record costs a clone of it plus a canonical
//! serialization of it. Registered before this harness existed: **1.3 to
//! 1.9 GB** of transient live heap for ONE call.
//!
//! **Why this is not measured as process peak**, which is the trap this file
//! exists to avoid. Peak resident is a maximum over a whole run, so on a
//! harness whose first fold is cold the clone sets the maximum whatever any
//! memo does downstream, and a peak reading would show no movement while the
//! mechanism was exactly right. Live heap around a single call is the
//! instrument that can actually answer the question, which is why this is an
//! allocator and not a resident-set reading.
//!
//! Ignored by default and driven by `MEMHISTORY_STORE`, because it needs a real
//! converted store and a builder slot. Run:
//!
//! ```text
//! MEMHISTORY_STORE=<.kin/kindb dir> cargo test -p kin-db --release \
//!   --test operation_record_heap_figures -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
